                <p>Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we also need long-lasting solutions.
                    That's why we work with countries around the world to help vulnerable people everywhere get the food
                    they need to survive and thrive.</p>

                <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
                <p> For someone at risk of homelessness, our support and advice can be the difference between finding
                    emergency accommodation or spending a night in their car.

                    Our campaigning work can mean the difference between being powerless or seeing legislative changes
                    to fight unfair evictions, rogue landlords and dangerous housing.</p>

                    child's life? In this article, I have discussed how education plays an important role in the overall
