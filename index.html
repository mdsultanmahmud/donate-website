                <p>Tackling hunger on the frontline of emergencies is critical, but we also need long-lasting solutions.
                    That's why we work with countries around the world to help vulnerable people everywhere get the food
                    they need to survive and thrive.</p>

                    Our campaigning work can mean the difference between being powerless or seeing legislative changes
                    to fight unfair evictions, rogue landlords and dangerous housing.</p>

                    child's life? In this article, I have discussed how education plays an important role in the overall

                <h2>Donate today to keep kids learning and growing.</h2>
                <p>Research shows a global surge in the number of young people reporting symptoms of clinical depression. Our schools are strained, canceling art programs when they need them most. Weâ€™re on a mission to change that.
    
                    Only 12% of public high schools offered one of the four arts disciplines, and only 17% offered all four. It has been proven that students who study art are 4 times more likely to be recognized for academic achievement and 3 times more likely to be awarded for school attendance.
                    
                    Transparency is one of our core values, so along with using every penny you donate to supply children with the art supplies they need, we also prove images of each handout on our Gallery page or Social Media accounts.</p>
